<p style="margin:0px 0px 6px;"></p>
<p style="margin:6px 0px;">The club did, however, perform well at the AFC Awards night, winning Club and Coach of the Year. We lost in the spelling bee, but we hope to continue this winning form on the pitch against Brisbane and Adelaide this week.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<div>The elusive Turner returns for a stint on the podcast that David Villa would be proud of, and with everyone else showing up for once, the team was 6 strong. 6 is also the number of games we’ve played in the A-League without a win, but despite what’s happening up in Brisbane, the Wanderers fans seem to be giving King Popa all their support, which they express in this weeks apparently silly ATBFeedback. The question of the week segment is back also, and is answered by Ivan.</div>
<div></div>
<div>On the bright side, we’re unbeaten in 2, and we cover both the Mariners and Newcastle games, as well as the upcoming Sydney Derby which is a must win for so many reasons - namely the bragging rights that come with it. It could be a first loss for Sydney and a first win for us, or it could potentially see both teams at completely opposite ends of the ladder if things go Sydneys way. Hopefully it’s the former.</div>

<div></div>
<div>We found that the podcast needed some improving too, so we introduce Question of the Week on this show, and I give a long, detailed history of podcasting which I’m sure is going to be as much fun for you to listen to as I had telling it, and I didn’t even insult anyone in the process. Well, I don’t think I did - I’ll keep an eye on twitter though. There’s that, W-League, Youth League, Nikminnit and all the other stuff on this weeks episode of Around the Bloc.</div>

		<description><![CDATA[<div>We lost to Melbourne on the weekend. Now, we’re not 1-4 negativity, but it was a pretty poor performance. It was, however, the first time we’ve actually conceded 4 goals but it didn’t seem to bother the 1,500 fans that travelled to see it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In other news, the W-League team beat Brisbane at Brisbane which is something the A-League squad hasn’t done in a while, and the Youth League squad beat Sydney, which could be a good omen for this weekend’s Derby - the first of the season. The RBB will once again descend (or stumble) upon the SFS in the hopes of taking 3 points home with them in the 8th edition of Popa vs the Smurfs. Will we turn their little village into Gargamel’s lair? Only time will tell.</div>

The Wanderers took 3 points away from both Melbourne and Korea this week in two epic performances which had us podcasters travelling through space and time to talk about them, whilst the travelling RBB went for a McFly to either destination, and thankfully nobody had to see a Doc or got involved in any Biff. On the pitch, the team was good enough not to Fox things up, apart from Shinji Ono, who’s number you get if you add Tannen eleven, who had a minor issue with the crossbar.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial, Verdana" size="2"><br /></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial, Verdana" size="2">So with the team shoring up 2nd spot in the A-League, and one more round to go in the ACL, we would need some sort of sports almanac to predict what’s going to happen in the coming weeks. You’ll just have to stay tuned to Around the Bloc.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial, Verdana" size="2">Sydney FC won the third Sydney Derby of the season thanks to the Wanderers playing like d’apu-zzo they left Allianz Stadium with their tail between their legs, knowing they won’t go top-or close to it for at least another week. The atmosphere was, as the French say, La Rocca’n, and the 40,000 that packed the ground left the NRL journo’s saying ‘Ono!’, just like Meggsy said after that through ball to Garcia. It was a Bridge too far for the Wanderers though, and Santa came early for the Sky Blue side of Sydney.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial, Verdana" size="2"><br /></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial, Verdana" size="2">Finally, the Red and Black hoops are off to China to ask ‘Guizhou, where you goin’ with that gun in your hand?’ and then back to play Adelaide at Wanderland.</font></div>

<div>A huge episode this week as two members of the RBB’s band, La Banda, join us to share their opinions on all the on and off the pitch happenings, which they drum into us, and are generally bass’d on their experiences in the RBB. Having been one of the cymbals of the active supporter group since day 1, they try not to repinique themselves as they recall how they formed, how the chants come together, and why they, for some reason, love Tom-Tomi Juric.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also on the show……………………………………………….. thats right - the silent protest. We delve into the why, the who, what, when, the where and the how, as we were all grabbing our hair and tearing it out wondering what the hell was going on. </div>

		<description><![CDATA[<div>And then there were two. With most members of the team missing, the dynamic duo of Steve and Brendan bring you this week’s podcast which is more exciting than a backup goalie’s debut.</div>

<div>It was a perfect start to a long run of games for the Wanderers, and with the ACL looming, we turn our attention to the failings of Brisbane Roar and William Gallas. We give credit where credit’s due, though, to everyone’s favourite Wanderers player, Jerrad Tyson (as quoted in The Guardian), and our resident Spanish commentator has something special for him too.</div>

<div>In other news, Shinji Ono is leaving the club, unlikely to return in 3 days, the W-League and Youth League teams struggle through their matches, although neither are crucified as much as Speccy is when we confront him about his ‘Prodigal Son’ call from last week. </div>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s episode 9 this week, and that means we’re one third of the way through the season. The Wanderers played a pretty boring nil-all draw on the weekend, and as a result, just like the team we’re playing next week, we all lose our Kewell. Our resident Spanish Commentator makes his return, but with nothing to commentate on we turn our attention to squad rotation and whether or not it’s a good thing. Speaking of going around in circles, the rest of the podcast includes W-League, Youth League, an “International wrap up”, and more. This is Around the Bloc. <br style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;line-height:17px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);" /></p>

The Wanderers played a pretty boring nil-all draw on the weekend, and as a result, just like the team we’re playing next week, we all lose our Kewell. Our resident Spanish Commentator makes his return, but with nothing to commentate on we turn our attention to squad rotation and whether or not it’s a good thing. Speaking of going around in circles, the rest of the podcast includes W-League, Youth League, an “International wrap up”, and more. This is Around the Bloc. <br style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;line-height:17px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);" /></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Around the Bloc returns for another week and, like Brisbane Roar, is only good for about 20 minutes, but still does enough to see out a full hour and a half. Turner, our resident caped crusader, tells us what he remembers of his antics from the away trip whilst Brendan makes one too many trips to Marconi. The boys finally get to dissect a loss but, with the help of <a class="_58cn" href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/atbfeedback">#ATBFeedback</a>, are able to see the positives. There’s good news for the Youth League, segues galore, and much much more on this edition of Around the Bloc.

		<description><![CDATA[<p><span><span style="vertical-align:baseline;">It was wet, wet, wet in Parramatta on Saturday night, but the love was certainly not all around in the stadium, with the two arguably biggest and most passionate groups of fans in the A-League battling it out in the stands. It was 82 minutes before Mark Bridge put away the winner, and less than 24 hours later the Wanderers finished the round at the top of the table for the first time this season. The bliss turns to diss in ATBFeedback, the joy for the Wanderers unfortunately stopped short of the W-League and Youth League games, and the Newcastle Jets and Michael Turner both pull off upsets over their opponents in the same game. All this and much more on this edition of Around The Bloc. </span></span>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>With Speccy benched, ATB is down to 4 men this week. TomiGun© put 2 away at home against the Reds whilst Polenz was lucky that only Adelaide’s secondary kit colour featured amongst the cards shown to him on Friday night. Cop Watch is back, unfortunately, due to fear of a receipt roll planet, and ATBTalkback reveals the pep talks that Wanderers fans would use to pump up the team. Finally, the W-League returns with a double header featuring the WanderWomen and the WanderKids of the National Youth League at Marconi, and the ATB tipping comp receives a shake up. All this and more, on this week’s edition of Around the Bloc.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Speccy returns and joins JAR, Erebus and a slightly inebriated Turner to discuss and celebrate the Wanderers winning the premiership in their first year as a football club. The release date of this podcast, April 4th, 2013, also happens to be the Wanderers first birthday (i.e. 1 year since the PM announced that it would be happening). A lot has happened since then, but despite the length of the podcast, not all of it is discussed as we stick to the most important parts of the last week. The team recorded on the day of the Newcastle game and that audio is included too. Also: ATB Talkback, Spanish Commentary from Pistola and more. Check us out on twitter @ATBWSW.

The actual match that was played between the Wanderers and Sydney FC is discussed, as opposed to off-field incident’s which everyone is sick of hearing about, along with everyones chances of making the finals (which admittedly gets a bit confusing), the transport and the RBBQ before the last regular season game in Newcastle, and turners infamous ‘Who Am I?’ segment gets another run.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>JAR, Speccy, Turner and Erebus rock up to Jerrad, Joey and Tahj’s pad for a game of UNO and a podcast ensues. The Wanderers winning against Mariners and going top of the league, the upcoming game against Wellington, an ‘in-the-making’ documentary about the Wanderers and the RBB and the recent charity work that has seen some underprivileged community groups receive tickets to the Nix game are all discussed. As it stands, JJ &#38; T are up 2-0 in the FIFA 13 stakes, comfortably defeating the team of JAR and two blokes who don’t know how to play FIFA in two games.
